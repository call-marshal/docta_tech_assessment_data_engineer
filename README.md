## Take Home Test: Reformat a Public Dataset for LLM Training

### Objective

The goal of this task is to prepare public datasets for more effective use in training and fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs). You are required to reformat a specific subset of a public dataset into a structured, consistent format to facilitate its usability.

### Detailed Instructions

#### 1. Dataset Selection and Preparation

* **Dataset:** You are assigned the `Headline` subset of the [AdaptLLM/finance-tasks](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhuggingface.co%2Fdatasets%2FAdaptLLM%2Ffinance-tasks) dataset.
* **Task Description:** Each entry in the `input` column contains multiple "Yes" or "No" questions alongside their respective answers. Your task is to:
  * Develop a Python script to parse and separate each question and its answer from the entry.
  * Save each question-answer pair in a structured JSON format as follows:
    ```
    {
      "id": "<unique_identifier>",
      "Question": "<question_text>",
      "Answer": "<answer_text>"
    }
    ```
  * You are encouraged to introduce additional attributes if needed to preserve the integrity and completeness of the information. Adding relevant tag information is strongly recommended.
* **Automation Requirement:** The task must be completed using Python. Manual editing or data manipulation is strictly prohibited. Your script should efficiently handle variations in data format within the column.

#### 2. Deliverables

* **Reformatted Dataset:** Provide the schema of the final format you adopted for saving the results.
* **Transformation Code:** Submit the complete code used for converting the dataset into the designated format.
* **Statistics:** Report the total number of question-answer pairs extracted from the dataset.
* **Performance Metrics:** Document the time taken to complete the dataset cleanup and transformation process.
